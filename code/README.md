# Numerical experiments

This directory contains all source code required to reproduce the numerical
experiments presented in the paper. It is developed for Julia v1.9.4.

To reproduce the numerical experiments, clone this repository, switch to the `code`
directory, and start Julia with the project set to the local directory:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/trixi-framework/paper-2024-generalized-upwind-sbp.git
cd paper-2024-generalized-upwind-sbp
cd code
julia --project=.
```
Since some of the experiments involve executing a given base setup many times with
different parameters, running all experiments can take multiple hours on a single core. We
thus recommend starting Julia with multiple threads by appending `--threads N` to the Julia
command, with `N` being the number of threads.

Then, execute the following commands in the Julia REPL:
```julia
julia> include("code.jl")

julia> print_USBP_operators()

julia> convergence_tests_1d_advection()

julia> convergence_tests_1d_euler()

julia> plot_spectra()

julia> local_linear_stability()

julia> experiments_isentropic_vortex()

Julia> experiments_kelvin_helmholtz_instability()

julia> dissipation_experiments_taylor_green_vortex()

```
The data and plot files generated by running these commands will be created either in the
current directory, in KH_plot_data, or in `../figures`.

The solution plots of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability are obtained by
running one of the following commands and visualizing the resulting
`*.vtu` files located in `out_dev` using Paraview. Again, we recommend starting
Julia with several threads to improve the runtime performance.

```julia
julia> include("code.jl")

julia> # one run - create figures after this block
    begin
        rm("out_dev", recursive = true, force = true)
        run_kelvin_helmholtz(; 
            N = 4,
            σ = -10^(-1), 
            initial_refinement_level = 6,
            flux_splitting = splitting_vanleer_haenel,
            polydeg = nothing 
        )
        trixi2vtk("out_dev/solution_*.h5"; 
            output_directory = "out_dev",
            reinterpolate = false, 
            data_is_uniform = false
        )
    end

            initial_refinement_level = 6,
            flux_splitting = splitting_steger_warming,
            polydeg = nothing 
        )
        trixi2vtk("out_dev/solution_*.h5"; 
            output_directory = "out_dev",
            reinterpolate = false, 
            data_is_uniform = false
        )
    end
